## About the course

- Understanding Model View Controler

We call the data bit  - the "Model" or Data Model.
We call the "making the next HTML" bit the "View" or "Presentation Layer".
We call the handling of input and the general orchestation of it all the "Controller".

- Django Data Models

Object Relational Mapping (ORM): We use those objects to store and retrieve data from the databases (SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle).
